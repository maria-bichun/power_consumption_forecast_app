### Power consumption forecast app

The solution underlying this app was originally the challenge of GlowByte Autumn Hack 2023 hackathon. The participants were to develop a predictive model to forecast power consumption of the region based on available data about power cunsumption in the past and factors influencing it. The model must take into account seasonal, temporal and other dependencies to obtain the most precise forecast. The model is to predict power consumption for 1 day ahead.

Our team's solution took the third place in the rating having shown high values of prediction quality metrics. The interface presented here was developed to demonstrate machine learning capabilities for solving real business problems, as well as for data visualization purposes

The app'features are:

* Forecast for today
* Forecasts history (fact/forecast comparison)
* Task and data review
* Switch of the whole app between EN/RU
